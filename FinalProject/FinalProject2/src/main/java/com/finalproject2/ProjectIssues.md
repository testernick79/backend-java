Project issues:

- New project caused the db and the computer to go out of sync for some reason
- had to run SET GLOBAL time_zone = '-7:00'; in order for the sever from my project to correctly
- I followed the video but when it got to getting the posts get request from postman i got 401, 400 errors.
- It was due to the fact that the videos had you add security to the project. 
- I asked for assistance and according to the mentors i worked with on saturday they were looking into it. I continued
to work on the project with not much luck. I ask the mentor another time if they figured it out, they had me zip my entire project and send it to them. I was hoping to hear somthing back, but i did not. At that point I was on my own because it was past 9pm. I spent a good amount of my week trying to get this project completed. However the resources I had avaliable were a bit out dated or slow to respond.
